            <p>Introduction:
                <br><br>

                Join me on a whimsical adventure as I share my journey of learning my first programming language at the
                tender age of 12. Driven by the desire to make some dough in the high-demand world of programming, I
                embarked on the thrilling path of code. From my first language, Python, to the aid of the programming
                god <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/codewithharry">Code With Harry</a> on YouTube, and even the
                joyous discovery of creating an AI project, this tale is filled with laughter, gratitude, and a
                fun-loving spirit and did I
                mention my quest into HTML, CSS, Scratch, and the exciting world of C# game development? Let's dive in!
                <br><br>

                Chapter 1: Python Pioneering:
                <br><br>
                At 12 years old, I set out on a mission to conquer Python, the language that would pave the way for my
                coding journey. While it proved challenging at times, I found solace in the <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/c/codewithharry">Code With Harry</a>
                channel, which transformed complex concepts into easily digestible bites of knowledge. With Harry as my
                programming god, I navigated Python's intricacies and gradually built my skills.
                <br><br>
                Chapter 2: The AI Adventure:
                <br><br>
                Filled with excitement and a touch of humor, I embarked on my first project—an AI creation. Although I
                can't claim full credit , with some guidance and pre-existing code, I proudly ventured into
                the world of artificial intelligence. It was a thrilling experience that sparked my imagination and
                ignited a passion for problem-solving through coding.
                <br><br>
                Chapter 3: The VS Code Quest:
                <br><br>
                Like any explorer, I encountered obstacles on my programming journey. One of these challenges was
                learning how to effectively use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with Python. It took six months of trial
                and error, but I persevered. Along the way, I discovered the joy of tinkering, experimenting, and
                unraveling the mysteries of this powerful tool. Each small victory brought me closer to mastering the
                art of code in VS Code.
                <br><br>
                Chapter 4: Gratitude for My Support System:
                <br><br>
                No adventure is complete without acknowledging those who supported me along the way. My heartfelt
                appreciation goes to my beloved <a href="https://www.facebook.com/purnalal.shrestha.1">sano baba </a>
                gifting me a laptop, which became my portal to the
                coding universe. I am forever grateful to my <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/puspa.shrestha.7549185">mom </a> and <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090052029815">dad</a> for their unwavering support
                and granting me
                the freedom to pursue my coding dreams. Their encouragement nurtured my passion and fueled my desire to
                explore the limitless possibilities of programming.
                <br><br>
                Chapter 5: Expanding My Coding Horizons:
                <br><br>
                Driven by curiosity and an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I delved into the realms of HTML, CSS, and
                Scratch. HTML and CSS allowed me to create visually stunning web pages, while Scratch provided an
                imaginative playground where I could bring interactive stories and games to life. Each new language
                brought a fresh wave of excitement and creativity to my coding repertoire.
                <br><br>
                Chapter 6: A Leap into C# Game Development:
                <br><br>
                Ever the adventurer, I set my sights on C# game development. With dreams of crafting immersive
                experiences in Unity, I took my first steps into this exciting domain. Although my journey in C# is
                still in its early stages, the prospect of building games ignites my imagination and keeps the laughter
                alive in my coding endeavors.
                <br><br>
                Conclusion:
                <br><br>
                My journey of learning my first programming language at 12 years old has been a rollercoaster ride
                filled with laughter, growth, and immense gratitude. From Python to AI, VS Code, and beyond, I've
                discovered that programming is more than a means to make bread—it's an opportunity for self-expression,
                problem-solving, and endless joy. With the unwavering support of my family, the guidance of mentors like
                Code With Harry, and an insatiable curiosity, I've gained the tools to shape my coding future. As I
                venture into the world of C# game development, my passion for learning continues to soar. So, fellow
                adventurers, embrace the whimsy, laughter, and sheer joy of coding—it's a magical journey that knows no
                bounds!
