            <p>Born on December 20, 2010, in the heart of Kathmandu, I am Srijan Shrestha—a young individual with a
                burning passion for breaking barriers and defying limitations. My journey began in the embrace of my
                loving parents, Raju Malla and Pushpa Shrestha, who bestowed upon me the gift of freedom to pursue my
                dreams. Their unwavering support has made me the luckiest person, as I am allowed to explore my
                boundless potential.
                <br><br>

                For the first 11 years of my life, I studied and thrived in Kathmandu, a bustling city tainted by
                pollution. Concerned for my health, my family made a decision that would shape my path. We relocated to
                Surkhet, seeking a cleaner environment and brighter prospects. This shift has been instrumental in
                nurturing my well-being and fostering personal growth.
                <br><br>
                At just 15 years old, I am determined to prove that age is just a number, and that great achievements
                can be achieved at a young age. With an unwavering spirit, I am on a mission to defy societal norms and
                showcase the limitless potential that lies within the younger generation. Through tireless dedication
                and a thirst for knowledge, I strive to leave a lasting impact, inspiring others to fearlessly pursue
                their dreams.
                <br><br>
