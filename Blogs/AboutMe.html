        <div class="article">
            <p>Born on December 20, 2010, in the heart of Kathmandu, I am Srijan Shrestha—a young individual with a burning passion for breaking barriers and defying limitations. My journey began in the embrace of my loving parents, Raju Malla and Pushpa Shrestha, who bestowed upon me the gift of freedom to pursue my dreams. Their unwavering support has made me the luckiest person, as I am allowed to explore my boundless potential.
                <br><br>

                For the first 11 years of my life, I studied and thrived in Kathmandu, a bustling city tainted by pollution. Concerned for my health, my family made a decision that would shape my path. We relocated to Surkhet, seeking a cleaner environment and brighter prospects. This shift has been instrumental in nurturing my well-being and fostering personal growth.
                <br><br>
                At just 15 years old, I am determined to prove that age is just a number, and that great achievements can be achieved at a young age. With an unwavering spirit, I am on a mission to defy societal norms and showcase the limitless potential that lies within the younger generation. Through tireless dedication and a thirst for knowledge, I strive to leave a lasting impact, inspiring others to fearlessly pursue their dreams.
                <br><br>
            </p>
