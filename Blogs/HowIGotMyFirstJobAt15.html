            <p>The average age to get a job around the world is 18–24. So, how did I manage to land my first
                job at just
                15? Who helped me become this capable? And is working this young even necessary? Let me walk you through
                it all.
                I’m a kid from Nepal who managed to get a job as a <b>computer teacher</b> at a local computer
                institute. While
                most people begin working in their late teens or early twenties, I started early. So, what made it
                possible for me to get a job at such a young age? </p>

            <h3>How Did I Manage to Get a Job at 15?</h3>


            <p class="txt1">There are four major reasons why I was able to get a job:</p>

            <h4> 1. Skill</h4>
            <p class="txt1">From a young age, I was deeply curious about computers. I explored how they work, learned
                programming
                languages, and gained hands-on experience. A big shoutout goes to my <i> Sano Baba </i>, who gifted me
                my
                first laptop—that moment changed everything and kickstarted my journey into the tech world. </p>

            <h4> 2. The Urge to Do Something Unique</h4>
            <p class="txt1"> I always wanted to be different. I didn’t want to follow the crowd—I wanted to stand out.
                This constant urge
                pushed me to learn things my peers weren’t even thinking about. It gave me the confidence and edge I
                needed
                to take on opportunities like this job. </p>
            <h4> 3. Parental Support</h4>
            <p class="txt1"> In my opinion, parental support plays a huge role in anyone’s success. While I believe
                people can still
                achieve great things without it, in my case, my parents were incredibly supportive. Their encouragement
                gave
                me the strength to pursue my goals fearlessly. </p>
            <h4>4. Financial Literacy</h4>
            <p class="txt1"> Understanding money at a young age changed my mindset completely. Financial literacy taught
                me the value of
                money and the importance of selling a skill. It prepared me for the real world in a way that school
                textbooks never could. </p>

            <h3>Who Made Me This Capable?</h3>
            <p class="txt1"> I give the biggest credit to <b>my mom. </b>Her freedom, understanding, and life
                experiences shaped me. She
                grew up in poverty and wanted me to understand the value of money. Her lessons gave me direction,
                strength,
                and wisdom. Thank you, Mom.</p>
            <h3>Is This Even Necessary?</h3>
            <p class="txt1"> In my opinion,<b> yes, it is necessary. </b> Working young helps build real-life
                experience, teaches you
                valuable lessons, and improves your ability to sell and communicate. It’s not just about earning
                money—it’s
                about learning how the world works. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="txt1">In short,<b> financial literacy, parental support, </b> and the </b>courage to be different
                helped me get a
                job at 15. I encourage you—or your kids—to start working young, but smart. That doesn’t mean quitting
                school; it means balancing both. Working after 10th grade can be a great option—it builds experience
                without
                affecting studies.
                And remember, it’s not about working your whole life. It’s about working smart, investing early, and
                eventually making your money work for <i>you </i>.</p>
